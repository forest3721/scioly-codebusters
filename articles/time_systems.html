                <h2><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> Understanding Global Time: GMT, UTC, and Leap Seconds</h2>
                <p>Time might seem simple, but in the world of computers and global communication, it gets surprisingly complex! When we talk about time systems in technology, two important terms often come up: <strong>GMT</strong> and <strong>UTC</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)</h3>
                <p>Historically, GMT was the "zero point" for time zones. It's the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. For a long time, it was the international standard for time around the world.</p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Greenwich, London</h4>
                    <p>Greenwich is a district of South East London, England, on the south bank of the River Thames. It is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0Â° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).</p>
                    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Map+of+Greenwich" alt="Map of Greenwich, London" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin: 10px auto;">
                </div>
                <p>The term "mean" in Greenwich Mean Time refers to the average time over a period, accounting for the slight variations in the Earth's rotation. It's a smoothed-out, theoretical average of the sun's passage over the Greenwich meridian, providing a consistent reference point for timekeeping.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-atom"></i> UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)</h3>
                <p>UTC is the modern, super-precise successor to GMT. It's the main time standard used globally today. UTC is based on incredibly accurate <strong>atomic clocks</strong>, making it much more precise than GMT, which relies on the Earth's slightly irregular rotation.</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Why UTC is Important</h4>
                    <p>While GMT is based on Earth's rotation, UTC uses atomic clocks for extreme accuracy. This precision is vital for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-satellite"></i> Satellite navigation (like GPS)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> Global financial transactions</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> Synchronized computer networks</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Leap Seconds: A Time Adjustment</h3>
                <p>Because UTC is so precise (atomic clocks) and GMT is based on Earth's slightly wobbly rotation, they can drift apart. To keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of GMT, a <strong>"leap second"</strong> is sometimes added. This usually happens on June 30th or December 31st.</p>
                <p>Leap seconds can be tricky for computer systems. If not handled correctly, they can cause software bugs or even system crashes!</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-server"></i> Time in Computer Systems: Skew & Synchronization</h2>
                <p>In large computer systems (like the internet or a network of servers), it's super important for all computers to agree on the exact time. This is called <strong>time synchronization</strong>.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h"></i> Clock Skew</h3>
                <p><strong>Clock skew</strong> is simply the difference in time between two clocks. Even very accurate computer clocks can slowly drift apart. If computers in a system have different times, it can lead to big problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-database"></i> <strong>Data Corruption:</strong> Information might be saved in the wrong order.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> <strong>Security Issues:</strong> Security checks often depend on exact timing.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> <strong>Inconsistent Logs:</strong> It becomes almost impossible to figure out what went wrong if event logs aren't in the correct time order.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> NTP (Network Time Protocol)</h3>
                <p><strong>NTP</strong> is the hero of time synchronization! It's a special set of rules that computers use to keep their clocks accurate over the internet. NTP servers are like super-accurate timekeepers that computers regularly check with to adjust their own time.</p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> How NTP Works Simply</h4>
                    <p>Your computer asks an NTP server for the current time. The server sends its time back. Your computer then figures out how long the message took and adjusts its own clock to match the server's time, making sure it's super accurate!</p>

            <section>
                <h2><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Time's Role in Cryptography & Security</h2>
                <p>You might wonder, "How does all this time talk relate to code-breaking and secrets?" It's actually very important!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-stamp"></i> <strong>Timestamping:</strong> Many modern secret codes and digital signatures use exact timestamps. This proves a message hasn't been changed or reused later.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-key"></i> <strong>One-Time Passwords (OTP):</strong> Systems like Google Authenticator use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). If your device's clock is out of sync with the server's clock, your OTPs won't work!</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> <strong>Website Security (SSL/TLS):</strong> The security certificates that make websites safe have start and end dates. If your computer's time is wrong, a safe website might look unsafe, or vice-versa.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, accurate time isn't just for telling what hour it is; it's a silent but powerful guardian of our digital world!</p>
